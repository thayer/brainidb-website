                  Dr. Songbai Ji is an Assistant Professor of Engineering at Thayer School of Engineering. Dr. Ji received his MS in Mechanical Engineering in 2001, and MS in Computer Science and DSc in Mechanical Engineering in 2003, all from Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Ji has substantial expertise and extensive experience in studying brain biomechanics in both quasi-static (e.g., in image-guided neurosurgery) and dynamic impact (e.g., in traumatic brain injury) conditions using subject-specific biomechanical models and advanced imaging techniques. Within the Brain Research Group, he is heavily involved in all aspects of the brain deformation project, including designing and implementing an advanced data acquisition system for intraoperative ultrasound and stereovision, imaging analysis, and biomechanical modeling to compensate for brain deformation. In addition, he leads an effort to study brain mechanical responses subjected to impact with subject-specific brain models, which, in collaboration with other researchers, aims at better understanding the mechanisms of sports-related mild traumatic brain injury.
